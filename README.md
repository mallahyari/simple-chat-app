# simple-chat-app

A simple chat app that integrates LiteLLM, Vercel AI SDK, and FastAPI. Although the app is simple, it has interesting features:

- LiteLLM allows to call (100+ LLMs) using the same unified format in addition to other features it offers like exception handling, log observability, and tracking cost, usage and latency.
- Vercel AI SDK makes creating chat UI blazing fast and easy
- FastAPI backend handles all the requests and response generation task.

It's worth mentioning that Vercel AI SDK is built for Javascript, but here I am showing how it can be integrated with Python, which is pretty cool.
